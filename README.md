This repository contains our Tools in Data Science (TDS) course project (v1) for the IITM BS Diploma program. The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end AI-assisted development and evaluation workflow where an application is automatically built, deployed, tested, and revised based on structured requests.
Overall, the TDS Project V1 demonstrates the integration of AI-assisted app generation, automated deployment, evaluation, and revision cycles, providing hands-on experience with complete data-driven development, LLM collaboration, and real-time continuous evaluation pipelines within a structured academic framework designed to reflect modern AI development practices.
